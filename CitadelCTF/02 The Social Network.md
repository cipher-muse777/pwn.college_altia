# DESCRIPTION 
OSINT pt1: The ascent begins. The first floor is not metal or binaries but of memory. 
Among the echoes, one voice lingers, of an early climber. He was among the earliest 
to challenge the Citadel, and though he failed, his traces remain scattered across the ruins of the old world.
It is said that the key to the next floor can be found by tracing the socials of this legendary climber.
Start by checking out citadweller on Instagram.
