# DESCRIPTION

Your quest continues, but you feel something odd about this room. The only artifact on 
this floor is a corrupted file held in the hands of a jet-black statue, frozen in the pose of 
a band mid-performance. The passcode to the next floor is hidden within this piece of music, but 
it canâ€™t be played, as if the wrong extension has scrambled it.
You must take the corrupted file and repair it to reveal the true code that will unlock the door forward.

**FLAG:** citadel{8lackM1D1wa5c00l}
we get a .wav file which is cannot play as it is corrupted (the extension is wrong, 
it should be a midi file as hinted by description mid)Using hex editor, we change the
file extention to midi file (change header to MThd) opening the changed midi file in a 
music editor, we can see the keys played in it. The key pattern on screen shows us the flag.
