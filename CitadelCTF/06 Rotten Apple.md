# DESCRIPTION 

Among the debris of this floor, you find a relic of sound: An 
album which turns out to be D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L by Panchiko, 
a long lost album. But the music is warped, as though it has undergone 
disc rot.The path forward is hidden in the distortion. Similar to how the album was warped,
the password to the next floor has been warped first by a factor of 47, then by a factor of 13. 
Untangle these changes to reveal the code and continue your ascent.

**FLAG:** citadel{b3tt3r_ROTt3n} 
rot hint tells us that we use rot cipher 47 and 13 hints at the rot numbers
no sensible flag forms with 13, so we used 47 to get flag
