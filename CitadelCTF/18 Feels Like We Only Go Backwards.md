terms: push your voice further than comfort, align yourself with the number he hides in the haze, 
and piece together the melody concealed within layers
of reverb. Only then will the music open the way upward.

We get a code which we can use by reverse engineering it. We open it into ghidra (reverse engineering software) 
thus we can see that FUN_00101240 is the main function (has constants) 1340 and 14c0 are for level 2 and level 1 (redundant), 
thus main is 1240 flag is formed using the code, giving us the flag
