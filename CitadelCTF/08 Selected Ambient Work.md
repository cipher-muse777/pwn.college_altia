# DESCRIPTION 

The symphonic adventure does not end here. On the next floor, a single song keeps echoing through the floor, repeating in a haunting loop. Amid the sound, you find a note left by a past candidate. It hints that the song holds a secret message, hidden in plain sight, much like how Aphex Twin concealed his face within his music with the help of spectrograms.
To move forward, you must find the message hidden in this sound. Note: Separate the words in the flag with _ and make it UPPERCASE. Example: citadel{S3L3CT3D_AMB13NT_W0RK}

**FLAG:** citadel{1_L0V3_1DM}
used https://databorder.com/transfer/morse-sound-receiver/ to play the morse code
The morse does not display message at first (there is background music messing with the code) we need to increase the frequency to like 750 for the letters to show up.
There a long message decoded on the spectogram, but we only take from when citadel{ appears. We use the part of text within {} brackets
