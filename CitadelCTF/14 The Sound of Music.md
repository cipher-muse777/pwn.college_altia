# DESCRIPTION 

OSINT pt2: citadweller had a newfound interest in tracking the music they last listened to and posting ratings
of new albums on various online platforms. The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms 
and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.
