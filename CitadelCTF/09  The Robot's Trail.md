# DESCRIPTION 
You enter a virtual maze, a labyrinth of shifting corridors and endless paths. 
A guardian robot patrols the floor, leaving a trail behind as it moves. Follow 
the path it carves, trace its movements carefully, and uncover the key it leads you to. 
Only by following the robotâ€™s trail can you reach the door to the next floor.
