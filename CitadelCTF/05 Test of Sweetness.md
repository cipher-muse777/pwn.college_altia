# DESCRIPTION 

This floor feels like a digital world. The space is an illusion, all pink and sweet, stretching around you in impossible patterns. Here, you are no longer a climber but just another user.
Ahead, a door glows faintly. It is the only path forward and requires a level of authority you do not yet have. Fragments of session memory flicker, hinting at what it might take to gain higher access.
