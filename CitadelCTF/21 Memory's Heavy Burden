# DESCRIPTION 

you now find yourself in the place where many climbers have been laid to rest. A cold wind moves through the temple grounds,
carrying whispers of the departed. Stone lanterns and marble graves reflect Buddhist traditions, their shadows 
stretching across the frost-covered earth. The temple rests in the shadow of a very iconic mountain, quiet and 
imposing. Every detail in the image, the arrangement of the graves, the lanterns, and the lingering scent of incense, 
holds clues to its true location. You need to uncover the exact coordinates of where you are to move on from here.

Note: round off coordinates to 3 decimal places.

Flag format: citadel{XX.XXX_XXX.XXX}

The description hints at a temple or a cemetary (also confirmed by the picture)
On Google Earth, approximate coordinates were coming as 35.XXX and 138.XXX
From description, it is a buddhist cemetary. Searching for all buddhist cemetaries north of mt.fuji, 
and checking them on street view, we land on the correct one (Tsugenji Temple), 
noting down its coordinates, and getting the flag (round the number to 3 decimal places)
