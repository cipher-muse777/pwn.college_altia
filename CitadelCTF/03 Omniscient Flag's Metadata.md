# DESCRIPTION 
As you step into the second chamber, 
a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers.
Known by countless names: “Apostle of Epilogue and Eternity,” “Lone Messiah” and many more lost to time.
They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies 
the key to ascend to the next chamber.
