# DESCRIPTION 

Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it:

```
twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}
```
When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchikoâ€™s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.
