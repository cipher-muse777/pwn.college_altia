# DESCRIPTION 

The floor is quiet, almost unnervingly so â€“ like the Citadel has paused to take your measure. 
A soft ring of presence settles around the chamber, the kind that marks a true landing: from here, 
it will ask for more and, in return, grant more. Etched into its surface is a sequence of numbers, 
worn and faint, as if time itself is eating them away. A whisper from the echoes guides you:
The message lies beneath the surface. Push it three steps forward in the cycle of life, and only 
then will the words emerge from the void.

# WRITE UP 
**FLAG:** citadel{br0_r34lly_unr0tt3d_m3_b4ck_t0_l1f3}
The python file gives us a fake file (don't fall for that)
A text file is also given with numbers 6895840967002953721051398351211751734500850509315790892845302801984496338433523326225010635779036738800318
The python code gives us the code as 3. We shift the numbers by 3 and convert it to string to get the flag
